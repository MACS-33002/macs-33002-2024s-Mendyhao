# Introduction to the project

This project aims to predict customer churn in banking industry using machine learning models. Over the past few decades, customers have had more and more options for where to store their money, making customer churn a big problem for many banks. The goal of my research is to use machine learning to predict churn, helping banks proactively engage with customers who are at risk of leaving. 

- Supervised models:

1) Logistic Regression;
2) K-nearest Neighbors;
3) Random Forest;

- Unsupervised models:

1) PCA;
2) K-means Clustering.

- Ensemble model:

1) Stacking Model.


This project asks the following questions:
1) What factors indicate a customer churning or not?
ANSWER:
Based on the three supervised models explored, the most important factors are age, geography, whether the customer is an active member, and the number of products they hold.

2) Can banks detect who are more likely to churn and take measures to those customers?
ANSWER:
Generally, yes! The model's strong AUC score of nearly 89% and a recall of 80% for the churn class indicate that banks can effectively identify and take measures for 80% of actual churn cases.
